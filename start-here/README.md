Hello! These are the various steps for the [fox game project][site] as outlined for [Frontend Masters][fem]. You'll want to pop over there for the lessons. [Here][game] is a deployed version of the final game.

## Running

`npm run dev` will run the project using parcel which doesn't used tsc and hence doesn't use tsconfig.json.

`npm run tsc & npm run build` will use tsc and tsconfig.json but will need a webserver to run.
